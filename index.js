//. # Fluture Express
//.
//. [![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/fluture-express.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluture-express)
//. [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/fluture-js/fluture-express.svg)](https://david-dm.org/fluture-js/fluture-express)
//. [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/fluture-js/fluture-express/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/fluture-js/fluture-express)
//.
//. Create Express middleware using Futures from [Fluture][].
//.
//. Allows for the definition of pure functions to be used as Express
//. middleware. This has benefits for testing and developer sanity.
//. Another benefit of this particular approach, where every middleware is
//. wrapped individually, is that it plays nicely with existing Express
//. middleware, and they can be used interchangably.
//.
//. ## Usage
//.
//. ### Node
//.
//. ```console
//. $ npm install --save fluture-express
//. ```
//.
//. On Node 12 and up, this module can be loaded directly with `import` or
//. `require`. On Node versions below 12, `require` or the [esm][]-loader can
//. be used.
//.
//. ### Deno and Modern Browsers
//.
//. You can load the EcmaScript module from various content delivery networks:
//.
//. - [Skypack](https://cdn.skypack.dev/fluture-express@6.0.0)
//. - [JSPM](https://jspm.dev/fluture-express@6.0.0)
//. - [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fluture-express@6.0.0/+esm)
//.
//. ### Usage Example
//.
//. ```js
//. // index.js
//.
//. const {dispatcher} = require ('fluture-express');
//. const app = require ('express') ();
//. const dispatch = dispatcher ('./actions');
//.
//. app.use (dispatch ('welcome'));
//. app.listen (3000);
//. ```
//.
//. ```js
//. // actions/welcome.js
//.
//. const {Json} = require ('fluture-express');
//. const Future = require ('fluture');
//.
//. module.exports = locals => req => Future.go (function* () {
//.   const user = yield locals.database.find ('sessions', locals.session.id);
//.   return withStatus (418) (Json ({welcome: user.name}));
//. });
//. ```
//.
//. For a more in-depth example, see the `example` directory.
//.
//. ## Documentation
//.
//. ### Pseudo types
//.
//. #### `Req`
//.
//. The Express Request object.
//.
//. #### `Res a`
//.
//. The Express Response object with a `locals` property of type `a`.

//. ### The Response type
//.
//. Fluture-Express mutates the response object for you, based on a
//. specification of what the response should be. This specification is
//. captured by the Response sum-type.
//.
//# Response :: Type
//.
//. The Response sum type encoded with [daggy][]. You probably don't need to
//. use this directly.
//.
//. ```hs
//. data Response a b = Respond (Array Head) (Body a)
//.                   | Next b
//. ```

});

//.
//. The Head sum type encoded with [daggy][]. You probably don't need to
//. use this directly.

//.           | Location String
//.           | Links (StrMap String)

//.
//. The Body sum type encoded with [daggy][]. You probably don't need to

//.
//. ```hs

//.             | Send Any
//.             | Json JsonValue
//.             | Stream (Future a Readable)

//. Stream every time it's consumed, or if it can't, reject with a value that
//. your Express error handler can handle.

//. ### Middleware creation utilities
//.
//# middleware :: (b -> Req -> Future a (Response a c)) -> (Req, Res b, (a -> Undefined)) -> Undefined
//.
//. Converts an action to an Express middleware.
//.
//. Takes a function that returns a [Future][] of a [Response][], and returns
//. an Express middleware that uses the returned structure to make the
//. appropriate mutations to the [`res`][].
//.
//. If the Future rejects, the rejection reason is passed into `next` for
//. further [error handling with Express][].
export const middleware = action => function dispatcher(req, res, next) {
  runAction (action.name || 'anonymous', action, req, res, next);
};

//# dispatcher :: String -> String -> (Req, Res a, (Any -> Undefined)) -> Promise Undefined
//.
//. Creates middleware that uses the export from the given file in the given
//. directory as an "action".
//.
//. It takes the file in two steps for convenience. You are encouraged to use
//. the first parameter to set up a sub-directory where all your actions live.
//.
//. The exported value should be a function of the same signature as given to
//. [`middleware`][].
export const dispatcher = directory => file => {
  const eventualAction = requireOrImport (path.resolve (directory, file));
  return function dispatcher(req, res, next) {
    return eventualAction.then (action => {
      runAction (file, action, req, res, next);
    });
